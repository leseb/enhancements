# Praxis Enhancement Proposals

Centralized enhancement proposals for all [Praxis]
repositories.

## How New Features Happen

```
Discussion -> Proposal -> Experimental -> Standard
```

1. **Discussion first.** Open a [GitHub Discussion]
   (category: "Idea") describing what you want and
   why. Collect feedback, build consensus, get
   maintainer sign-off. Nothing moves forward
   without this step.

2. **Proposal.** Once a maintainer approves the
   direction, file a proposal here (What + Why
   only). Iterate on the How section after the
   direction is accepted.

3. **Experimental.** Prototype in the [experimental
   repo], then ship behind an experimental flag in
   the target repo. Experimental features may
   change or be removed at any time.

4. **Standard.** After a soak period, maintainers
   promote the feature to standard/released.

> **Nothing before standard is guaranteed.**
> A discussion does not guarantee a proposal will
> be accepted. An accepted proposal does not
> guarantee an experimental implementation. An
> experimental feature does not guarantee promotion
> to standard. Features can be changed, reworked,
> or removed at any stage before reaching standard.

See [docs/process.md](docs/process.md) for the full
